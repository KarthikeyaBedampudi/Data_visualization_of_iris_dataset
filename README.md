# Data_visualization_of_iris_dataset
 The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for demonstrating data visualization and analysis techniques. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. To visualize this dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn,

# **Iris Data Visualization**

This project provides a comprehensive exploration and visualization of the famous Iris dataset using Python libraries, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to showcase different techniques for visualizing data and understanding relationships between features in the dataset.

# **Dataset**

It consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

# **Visualizations**

**The notebook contains the following visualizations:**

**Pair Plot**: Visualizes pairwise relationships in the dataset using scatter plots and histograms, colored by sepal width.

**Pie Chart**: Displays the frequency of each species in the dataset.

**Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, with points colored by species.

**Feature Distribution**: Uses pair plots to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal features, colored by petal width.

**Joint Plot**: Highlights the relationship between sepal length and sepal width using a scatter plot.

**KDE Plots**: Kernel Density Estimation plots for the 'Setosa' species, visualizing sepal and petal features.

# **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the power and versatility of data visualization in understanding and exploring datasets. By using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we have effectively visualized various aspects of the Iris dataset, uncovering relationships and patterns within the data. These visualizations provide valuable insights, making it easier to grasp the differences between species and the interrelationships between features.
